## iOS 13 notice

iOS 13 contains the [`VNDocumentCameraViewController`][ios-scanner], which is an
Apple-provided class that is likely to achieve better results and have less bugs
than this pod.

If your app is targeting iOS 13 or higher, please consider using it instead of
this pod.

[ios-scanner]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionkit/vndocumentcameraviewcontroller

## Requirements

- iOS 10.0 SDK or later

| Xcode Version | YesWeScan |
|---------------|-----------|
| <= 10.1       | <= 1.3.0  |
| >= 10.2       | => 2.0.0  |

## Scanner Preview

## Installation

### CocoaPods

YesWeScan is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).
To install it, simply add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'YesWeScan', ~> '2.0'
```

### Carthage

YesWeScan is also available via [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).
Add the following line to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "adorsys/YesWeScan"
```

### Swift Package Manager

Starting in version 2.2.0,
[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is also supported ðŸŽ‰

Add it to your project like this:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/adorsys/YesWeScan.git", from: "2.2.0")
]
```

## Usage

The scanner needs access to the camera.
In order to allow this, your `Info.plist` must contain the `NSCameraUsageDescription` key.

![An info.plist entry for NSCameraUsageDescription](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adorsys/YesWeScan/master/Images/CameraUsagePlist.png)

### Scanner View Controller

The main class in this project is `ScannerViewController`. You can access it
with `import YesWeScan`.

```swift
import YesWeScan

class ViewController: UIViewController {
  var scannedImage: UIImage?

  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    let scanner = ScannerViewController()
    scanner.delegate = self
    navigationController?.pushViewController(scanner, animated: true)
  }
}
```

### Delegate Methods

The scanner will __not__ capture images without a delegate.
You should therefore set the `delegate` property of the `ScannerViewController`.

You will then receive calls when the scanner found an image of suitable quality:

```swift
extension ViewController: ScannerViewControllerDelegate {
  func scanner(_ scanner: ScannerViewController, didCaptureImage image: UIImage) {
    scannedImage = image
    navigationController?.popViewController(animated: true)
  }
}
```

### Scanner Quality

You can customize the scanner's accuracy using the `jitter` property. Higher
values will make it easier to capture an image, but it won't be as steady.

The default value here is `100`.

The Scanner resolution can be configured by passing the `ScannerViewController`
an `AVCaptureSession.Preset` during initialization. The default value is
`.high`. If the given preset isn't supported by the capture device, it'll fall
back to the default value.

### Image Features needed before automatically capture

You can change the variable `scanningQuality` to control the scanning quality
of the image. Changes to `scanningQuality` will influence the number of
features required before taking a capture.

```swift
enum Quality {
  case high, medium, fast
}
```

The default value is `.medium` and this variable is available
in `ScannerViewController`.

```swift
scanner.scanningQuality = .fast
```

### UI Configuration

The scanner's UI can be configured using the initializer:

```swift
ScannerViewController(config: [.torch, .manualCapture])
```

The following options are available:

+ `.targetBraces`: A button to toggle targeting braces
+ `.torch`: A button for controlling the torch
+ `.manualCapture`: A manual camera shutter
+ `.progressBar`: Show a progress bar for the current scan

The default value here is `.all`.

You can also configure the `previewColor` (color of scan preview rect) and
`braceColor` (color of the target finder braces).

The defaults here are `UIColor.green` and `UIColor.red`, respectively.

### Siri Shortcuts

The scanner example project supports Siri Shortcuts since iOS 12*.
The User own shortcut opens the app and navigates to the Document Scanner.
You can find the implementation in the example project.

The implementation works as follows:
Activate Siri in the project and add a `NSUserActivityTypes` identifier in `info.plist`.
Then activate Siri Shortcut adding following lines in the project:

```swift
if #available(iOS 12.0, *) {
  let identifier = Bundle.main.userActivityIdentifier
  let activity = NSUserActivity(activityType: identifier)
  activity.title = "The String the User will see in preferences"
  activity.userInfo = ["Document Scanner": "open document scanner"]
  activity.isEligibleForSearch = true
  activity.isEligibleForPrediction = true
  activity.persistentIdentifier = NSUserActivityPersistentIdentifier(identifier)
  view.userActivity = activity
  activity.becomeCurrent()
}
```

To call a specific function, like `openDocumentScanner()`, add this to `AppDelegate`:

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, continue userActivity: NSUserActivity, restorationHandler: @escaping ([UIUserActivityRestoring]?) -> Void) -> Bool {
  if #available(iOS 12.0, *) {
    guard userActivity.activityType == Bundle.main.userActivityIdentifier,
      let navigationController = window?.rootViewController as? UINavigationController,
      let viewController = navigationController.children.first as? ViewController else {
        return false
    }
    viewController.openDocumentScanner()
    return true
  } else {
    return false
  }
}
```

### Using the scanner directly

It's also possible to use the scanner class without the `ScannerViewController`
class (that is part of this pod) directly.

As an example how to do this, take a look at the [`CustomUIViewController`][custom VC] class.
